# Additional Informations

1. News.opml is a file you can open in most of the RSS Feeds readers and I recommend to do so.
   You can open OPML files with [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) (free and open-source RSS reader).
2. If you need more _informations_ about _anything_, please reach out to me. I guess if you have access to this file, you already know how you can do so.
